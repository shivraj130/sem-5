HTML Structure
---------------
Defines the skeleton of the webpage.
Contains two containers (div blocks), each with:
  >A heading (h2) "Live Character Counter".
  >A text area (textarea) for user text input.
  >A paragraph (p) that shows the number of characters typed, updated dynamically by JavaScript.

CSS Styling
-------------

body:
  >Uses a clean sans-serif font.
  >Centers content vertically and horizontally using Flexbox.
  >Light gray background for the whole page.

.container:
  >White background box with padding.
  >Border and margin for spacing.
  >Fixed width: 500px so the text inputs are neatly contained.

h2:
  >Bold, slightly larger font titles above each counter.

textarea:
  >Expands the full width of its container.
  >Initial height of 100px.
  >Styled with padding, border, and resizable vertically.

p:
  >Displays the live character count neatly under the text area.

JavaScript Functionality
-------------------------
This part makes the counters live (update automatically as the user types).

1.First Counter (Empty Textbox)
  >Gets a reference to the "text-input" textarea and "char-count" span.
  >Adds an event listener for the "input" event (fires whenever user types).
  >Updates the char-count span to show the length of typed text (value.length).

2.Second Counter (Pre-filled Textbox)
  >Gets "text-input-2" textarea and "char-count-2" span.
  >Same logic: updates counter as the user edits text.
