Experiment 3
Admin Dashboard with Grid Display and Theme Switch using HTML and CSS

Overview
In this experiment, I created an Admin Dashboard using CSS Grid Layout for structure and
a checkbox-based theme switcher for toggling between light and dark modes, all implemented using HTML and CSS—without JavaScript.

HTML structure:

    1. Added a hidden checkbox at the top that works as a theme  swticher between light and dark mode using only CSS.
    2. Used a main container div with CSS Grid to split layout into header, nav, main and footer.
    3. Header has the dashboard title and a label to click for toggling dark mode.
    4. Navigation is a side menu with links for Home, User and Settings. 
    5. Main area with a welcome message and text for charts or reports. 
    6. Footer with bottom with “© 2025 Admin Panel” text.
    7. Theme changes happen by updating CSS variables when the checkbox is checked, no Javascript used. 


CSS Key Features:

:root Selector and CSS Variables
                :root is a special CSS selector that targets the root element  of the HTML document.
                It is commonly used to define CSS custom properties (variables) for colors, font sizes, and other reusable values.
                In this project, variables like --header-bg-color and --main-bg-color store color values,
                making it easy to update the theme by changing the variables in one place.
